On the left side of the screen we will be shown the merchant who can sell us $STRW Tokens, we just have to click on "Buy".

An alert will be displayed which will give us knowledge of the cost that will have to be pay to get $STRW Tokens (1 NEAR), if we agree we will have to click on "Buy".

After showing the animations we will be shown the amount of $STRW Tokens that we have acquired, it is worth mentioning that the amount of Tokens will be obtained randomly in a range of 1,000 to 10,000 Tokens.

Once our $STRW Tokens have been purchased, the merchant will disappear, so we will have to wait 12 hours from the last purchase to purchase $STRW Tokens again.

### Navigate in the map
In order to navigate the Burrito Battle map, the first thing we must do is select one of our Burritos, for this we must access to the "Barn" from the menu.
![Image text](https://github.com/cloudmex/burrito-battle-ui/blob/main/assets/screenshot_1.png)

In this section all our purchased Burritos will be shown, we must click on one of them and on the big card click on "Select Burrito".

### Fight with wild Burritos
To fight against wild Burritos you must navigate the entire map until you find one.
![Image text](https://github.com/cloudmex/burrito-battle-ui/blob/main/assets/screenshot_10.png)

Once you find one, a warning will be displayed where we can choose whether to fight or not, in case of fleeing the combat we can continue navigate normally for the map, but if we decide to enter the combat then we will have to finish or give up the battle.
![Image text](https://github.com/cloudmex/burrito-battle-ui/blob/main/assets/screenshot_11.png)

Once inside the combat, depending on the speed of each Burrito it will be the one who attacks first, the battle consists of a turn-based system, where we will have to choose between a weak attack and a heavy one (maximum 3) or in the case of defending we can use up to a maximum of 3 shields to evade the attack, this process will be repeated until some Burrito loses the battle.
![Image text](https://github.com/cloudmex/burrito-battle-ui/blob/main/assets/screenshot_12.png)
![Image text](https://github.com/cloudmex/burrito-battle-ui/blob/main/assets/screenshot_13.png)

In the case of not wanting to fight, then we can choose to surrender, so a window will be displayed warning that giving up the battle will cost one life of our Burrito.

In the event that our Burrito is the winner, based on the levels of the burritos that fought, it will be the reward obtained in $STRW Tokens.

If we lose the fight, our burrito will lose a life and we will receive only 300 $STRW Tokens.

### Participate in Incursion

To participate in a raid we must first access the meadow.
![Image text](https://github.com/cloudmex/burrito-battle-ui/blob/main/assets/screenshot_1.png)

We must look for the coliseum area and approach it to interact.
![Image text](https://github.com/cloudmex/burrito-battle-ui/blob/main/assets/screenshot_25.png)

If there is an active Incursion we will be shown the details of the players that are already inside, if there is space then we can register one of our Burritos by clicking on the "Select Burrito" button, up to a maximum of 10 players can participate in each Incursion.
![Image text](https://github.com/cloudmex/burrito-battle-ui/blob/main/assets/screenshot_26.png)

We will be shown a window where we must select one of our Burritos to participate in the Incursion.
![Image text](https://github.com/cloudmex/burrito-battle-ui/blob/main/assets/screenshot_27.png)

Now we just have to wait for the Incursion to start, once this time is over we will be redirected to the battle.
![Image text](https://github.com/cloudmex/burrito-battle-ui/blob/main/assets/screenshot_28.png)

Once inside the battle, we will follow the same dynamics as the battle against wild burritos, we will have to choose what type of attack to carry out or in case of defending we choose if we want to use one of our shields. The life of the "Mega Burrito" will be shared between all players, so the more players participating, will be more likely to beat the "Mega Burrito".
![Image text](https://github.com/cloudmex/burrito-battle-ui/blob/main/assets/screenshot_29.png)
![Image text](https://github.com/cloudmex/burrito-battle-ui/blob/main/assets/screenshot_30.png)

At the end of the Incursion, a message will be displayed mentioning that the coliseum was destroyed by the battle and that we will have to wait a while for it to be rebuilt and be able to participate again.
![Image text](https://github.com/cloudmex/burrito-battle-ui/blob/main/assets/screenshot_31.png)

A last window will be shown where it will tell us that to recover our Burrito we must click "Accept", in case of winning the Incursion then we will also be granted the rewards, these depend on the damage by our Burrito done to the "Mega Burrito".
